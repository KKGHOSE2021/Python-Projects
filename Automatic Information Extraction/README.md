This is a natural language processing project, where efficient string-matching algorithms were developed to extract relevant information from Wikipedia. Extraction  of  Relational  Patterns  is  particularly  useful  for various  Natural  Language  Processing  tasks  including information  extraction  from  text,  question  answering, paraphrasing, as they allow to retrieve relevant information for a particular relation. In this work, String matching algorithms have been developed for  different  relational  types  in  different  cases, such that we  can  retrieve  related  sentences  for  each particular relation from a corpus extracted from Wikipedia (eka. WikiCorpus).  In string  matching processes,  we  will  extract  only  those  sentences  from WikiCorpus  that  match  the searched  string  from  a  pair  of predefined  relation-patterns  (domain  and  range)  to  our candidate sentences in WikiCorpus, so that we can collect a set of sentences for each particular relation.
